is an anti-authoritarian political and social philosophy that rejects hierarchies deemed unjust and advocates their replacement with self-managed, self-governed societies based on voluntary, cooperative institutions. These institutions are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations. Anarchism's central disagreement with other ideologies is that it holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful. Anarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum, and much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics. As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism, or similar dual classifications.\",\n"," {'links': {(16, 34): {'1030234': 1.0}},\n","  'entities': [(16, 34, 'anti-authoritarian')]})"]},"execution_count":30,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["dataset[0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-25T12:09:14.131583Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-25T12:09:14.131201Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-25T12:09:59.581985Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-25T12:09:59.581166Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-25T12:09:14.131547Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from spacy.training import Example\n","\n","TRAIN_EXAMPLES = []\n","if \"sentencizer\" not in nlp.pipe_names:\n","    nlp.add_pipe(\"sentencizer\")\n","sentencizer = nlp.get_pipe(\"sentencizer\")\n","\n","for text, annotation in dataset:\n","    try:\n","        example = Example.from_dict(nlp.make_doc(text), annotation)\n","        example.reference = sentencizer(example.reference)\n","        TRAIN_EXAMPLES.append(example)\n","    except: \n","        pass\n","    "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<h1>Entity Linker being linked to the knowledge base</h1>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":51,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-25T12:25:11.907973Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-25T12:25:11.907289Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-25T12:25:16.785601Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-25T12:25:16.784750Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-25T12:25:11.907928Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from spacy.ml.models import load_kb\n","\n","entity_linker = nlp.add_pipe(\"entity_linker\", config={\"incl_prior\": False}, last=True)\n","#entity_linker = nlp.get_pipe(\"entity_linker\")\n","entity_linker.initialize(get_examples=lambda: TRAIN_EXAMPLES, kb_loader=load_kb(output_dir / \"my_kb\"))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<h1> Training the entity linker</h1>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":52,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-25T12:25:21.473999Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-25T12:25:21.473599Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-25T12:26:27.363172Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-25T12:26:27.362268Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-25T12:25:21.473960Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from spacy.util import minibatch, compounding\n","\n","with nlp.select_pipes(enable=[\"entity_linker\"]):   #
